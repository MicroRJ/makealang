Build your own programming language and make a game with it. (Unreleased)

This repository teaches you how to build a programming language from scratch in C and, as a bonus, how to create a game with it.

I'm currently working on the script for the accompanying video, and the code is still in the testing phase.

The programming language we’ll be creating is simple yet extendable, allowing you to add as many features as you want later on while ensuring it scales effectively.

You’ll learn the essentials of lexing, parsing, generating, and running code.

Additionally, you’ll gain a solid understanding of the core concepts behind compiler design.

The language we’ll build is actually a subset of an unreleased, fully-featured programming language I’ve already used to create several games and other graphical applications.
